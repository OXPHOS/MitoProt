Application      MitoProt II
First Release    October 1996
Last Update      December 2006
Version          1.101
Description      It supplies a series of parameters that permit
                 theoretical evaluation on mitochondrial targeting
                 sequences and the importability.
                 Finally, it provides the possibility to predict
                 mitochondrial proteins harbouring targeting
                 sequences.

Notes            1- MitoProt II is available as a "basic"
                   application, or as a "rapid" one. The rapid one
                   needs 68020 processor, or later, and FPU. Both
                   need system 6.0.2 or later. Older system versions have
                   not been assayed, but perhaps do work well too.
                 2- A version for unix machines is also available without
                   using the graphic cabapilities.
                 3- A mail server is available to test a sequence sending a
                   message with the sequence to mitoprot@biologie.ens.fr
                   You can send a message with help in the body to
                   obtain instrutions.

MitoProt II has been designed for Macintosh computers, using
THINK Pascal 4.0.2. For unix machines it has been designed in
ADA95 using the Gnat compiler.
